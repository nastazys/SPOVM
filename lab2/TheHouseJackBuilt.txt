That lay in the house that Jack built.
That ate the malt 
That killed the rat, 
That worried the cat,
That tossed the dog, 
That milk'd the cow with the crumpled horn,
That kissed the maiden all forlorn, 
That married the man all tatter'd and torn, 
That waked the priest all shaven and shorn,
That kept the cock that crow'd in the morn, 
This is the farmer sowing his corn, 
This is the farmer sowing his corn, 
That kept the cock that crow'd in the morn, 
That waked the priest all shaven and shorn,
That married the man all tatter'd and torn, 
That kissed the maiden all forlorn, 
That milk'd the cow with the crumpled horn,
That tossed the dog, 
That worried the cat, 
That killed the rat, 
That ate the malt 
That lay in the house that Jack built.
